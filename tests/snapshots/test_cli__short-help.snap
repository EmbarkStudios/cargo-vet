        --readonly-lockless
            Do not modify or lock the store (supply-chain) directory

    -V, --version
            Print version information

        --verbose <VERBOSE>
            How verbose logging should be (log level) [default: warn] [possible values: off, error,
            warn, info, debug, trace]
