# cargo vet CLI manual

> This manual can be regenerated with `cargo vet help-markdown`

Version: `cargo-vet 0.1.0`

Supply-chain security for Rust

### USAGE
cargo vet [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND]

### OPTIONS
#### `--all-features`
Activate all available features

#### `--diff-cache <DIFF_CACHE>`
Use the following path as the diff-cache.

The diff-cache stores the summary results used by vet's suggestion machinery. This is
automatically managed in vet's tempdir, but if you want to manually store it somewhere
more reliable, you can.

This mostly exists for testing vet itself.

#### `--exclude <SPEC>`
Exclude packages from being processed

#### `--features <FEATURES>`
Space-separated list of features to activate

#### `--filter-graph <FILTER_GRAPH>`
Filter out different parts of the build graph and pretend that's the true graph.

Example: `--filter-graph="exclude(any(eq(is_dev_only(true)),eq(name(serde_derive))))"`

This mostly exists to debug or reduce projects that cargo-vet is mishandling. Combining
this with `cargo vet --output-format=json dump-graph` can produce an input that can be
added to vet's test suite.

The resulting graph is computed as follows:

1. First compute the original graph

2. Then apply the filters to find the new set of nodes

3. Create a new empty graph

4. For each workspace member that still exists, recursively add it and its dependencies

This means that any non-workspace package that becomes "orphaned" by the filters will be
implicitly discarded even if it passes the filters.

Syntax: a comma-separated list of filters to apply.

Possible filters:

* `include($query)`: only include packages that match this filter

* `exclude($query)`: exclude packages that match this filter

Possible queries:

* `any($query1, $query2, ...)`: true if any of the listed queries are true

* `all($query1, $query2, ...)`: true if all of the listed queries are true

* `eq($property)`: true if the package has this property

* `neq($property)`: true if the package doesn't have this property

Possible properties:

* `name($string)`: the package's name (i.e. `serde`)

* `version($version)`: the package's version (i.e. `1.2.0`)

* `is_root($bool)`: whether it's a root in the original graph (ignoring dev-deps)

* `is_workspace_member($bool)`: whether the package is a workspace-member (can be
tested)

* `is_third_party($bool)`: whether the package is considered third-party by vet

* `is_dev_only($bool)`: whether it's only used by dev (test) builds in the original
graph

#### `-h, --help`
Print help information

#### `--locked`
Do not pull in new "audits"

#### `--log-file <LOG_FILE>`
Instead of stderr, write logs to this file (only used after successful CLI parsing)

#### `--manifest-path <PATH>`
Path to Cargo.toml

#### `--no-default-features`
Do not activate the `default` feature

#### `--output-file <OUTPUT_FILE>`
Instead of stdout, write output to this file

#### `--output-format <OUTPUT_FORMAT>`
The format of the output

\[default: human]  
\[possible values: human, json]  

#### `-p, --package <SPEC>`
Package to process (see `cargo help pkgid`)

#### `-V, --version`
Print version information

#### `--verbose <VERBOSE>`
How verbose logging should be (log level)

\[default: warn]  
\[possible values: off, error, warn, info, debug, trace]  

#### `--workspace`
Process all packages in the workspace

## cargo vet help 
Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

### cargo vet help USAGE
```
cargo vet help [SUBCOMMAND]...
```

### cargo vet help ARGS
#### `<SUBCOMMAND>...`
The subcommand whose help message to display

<br><br><br>
## cargo vet help-markdown 
Print --help as markdown (for generating docs)

### cargo vet help-markdown USAGE
```
cargo vet help-markdown
```

### cargo vet help-markdown OPTIONS
#### `-h, --help`

<br><br><br>
## cargo vet dump-graph 
Print a mermaid-js visualization of the cargo build graph as understood by cargo-vet

### cargo vet dump-graph USAGE
```
cargo vet dump-graph [OPTIONS]
```

### cargo vet dump-graph OPTIONS
#### `--depth <DEPTH>`
The depth of the graph to print (for a large project, the full graph is a HUGE MESS)

\[default: first-party]  
\[possible values: roots, workspace, first-party, first-party-and-directs, full]  

#### `-h, --help`
Print help information

<br><br><br>
## cargo vet regenerate-unaudited 
Regenerate the 'unaudited' entries to try to minimize them and make the vet pass

## cargo vet fmt 
Reformat all of vet's files (in case you hand-edited them)

### cargo vet fmt USAGE
```
cargo vet fmt

## cargo vet suggest 
Suggest some low-hanging fruit to review

### cargo vet suggest USAGE
```
cargo vet suggest [OPTIONS]
```

### cargo vet suggest OPTIONS
#### `--guess-deeper`
Try to suggest even deeper down the dependency tree (approximate guessing).

By default, if a dependency doesn't have sufficient audits for *itself* then we won't
try to speculate on anything about its dependencies, because we lack sufficient
information to say for certain what is required of those dependencies. This overrides
that by making us assume the dependencies all need the same criteria as the parent.
