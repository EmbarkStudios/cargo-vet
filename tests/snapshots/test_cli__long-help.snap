cargo-vet 0.1.0
Supply-chain security for Rust

USAGE:
    cargo vet [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND]

OPTIONS:
        --all-features
            Activate all available features

        --diff-cache <DIFF_CACHE>
            Use the following path as the diff-cache.
            
            The diff-cache stores the summary results used by vet's suggestion machinery. This is
            automatically managed in vet's tempdir, but if you want to manually store it somewhere
            more reliable, you can.
            
            This mostly exists for testing vet itself.

        --exclude <SPEC>
            Exclude packages from being processed

        --features <FEATURES>
            Space-separated list of features to activate

        --filter-graph <FILTER_GRAPH>
            Filter out different parts of the build graph and pretend that's the true graph.
            
            Example: `--filter-graph="exclude(any(eq(is_dev_only(true)),eq(name(serde_derive))))"`
            
            This mostly exists to debug or reduce projects that cargo-vet is mishandling. Combining
            this with `cargo vet --output-format=json dump-graph` can produce an input that can be
            added to vet's test suite.
            
            The resulting graph is computed as follows:
            
            1. First compute the original graph
            
            2. Then apply the filters to find the new set of nodes
            
            3. Create a new empty graph
            
            4. For each workspace member that still exists, recursively add it and its dependencies
            
            This means that any non-workspace package that becomes "orphaned" by the filters will be
            implicitly discarded even if it passes the filters.
            
            Syntax: a comma-separated list of filters to apply.
            
            Possible filters:
            
            * `include($query)`: only include packages that match this filter
            
            * `exclude($query)`: exclude packages that match this filter
            
            Possible queries:
            
            * `any($query1, $query2, ...)`: true if any of the listed queries are true
            
            * `all($query1, $query2, ...)`: true if all of the listed queries are true
            
            * `eq($property)`: true if the package has this property
            
            * `neq($property)`: true if the package doesn't have this property
            
            Possible properties:
            
            * `name($string)`: the package's name (i.e. `serde`)
            
            * `version($version)`: the package's version (i.e. `1.2.0`)
            
            * `is_root($bool)`: whether it's a root in the original graph (ignoring dev-deps)
            
            * `is_workspace_member($bool)`: whether the package is a workspace-member (can be
            tested)
            
            * `is_third_party($bool)`: whether the package is considered third-party by vet
            
            * `is_dev_only($bool)`: whether it's only used by dev (test) builds in the original
            graph

    -h, --help
            Print help information

        --locked
            Do not pull in new "audits"

        --log-file <LOG_FILE>
            Instead of stderr, write logs to this file (only used after successful CLI parsing)

        --manifest-path <PATH>
            Path to Cargo.toml

        --no-default-features
            Do not activate the `default` feature

        --output-file <OUTPUT_FILE>
            Instead of stdout, write output to this file

        --output-format <OUTPUT_FORMAT>
            The format of the output
            
            [default: human]
            [possible values: human, json]

    -p, --package <SPEC>
            Package to process (see `cargo help pkgid`)

    -V, --version
            Print version information

        --verbose <VERBOSE>
            How verbose logging should be (log level)
            
            [default: warn]
            [possible values: off, error, warn, info, debug, trace]

        --workspace
            Process all packages in the workspace
